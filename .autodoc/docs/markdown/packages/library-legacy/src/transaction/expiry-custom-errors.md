This file contains three custom error classes that are specific to the Solana blockchain and are related to transaction expiration. 

The first class is `TransactionExpiredBlockheightExceededError`. This error is thrown when a transaction's block height has been exceeded, meaning that the transaction has not been confirmed in a timely manner and has been dropped from the mempool. The error message includes the signature of the transaction that has expired. 

The second class is `TransactionExpiredTimeoutError`. This error is thrown when a transaction has not been confirmed within a specified timeout period. The error message includes the signature of the transaction and suggests using Solana Explorer or CLI tools to check the status of the transaction. 

The third class is `TransactionExpiredNonceInvalidError`. This error is thrown when a transaction's nonce is no longer valid, meaning that the transaction has been replaced by a newer transaction with a higher nonce. The error message includes the signature of the transaction that has expired. 

These error classes can be used in the larger Solana project to handle transaction expiration errors in a more specific and informative way. For example, if a developer is building a dApp on Solana and a user's transaction fails due to expiration, the developer can catch the appropriate error class and display a user-friendly error message that includes the transaction signature and instructions on how to check the status of the transaction. 

Here is an example of how the `TransactionExpiredTimeoutError` class could be used in a Solana dApp:

```
try {
  // Send transaction and wait for confirmation
  const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(transaction, payerAccount, {
    skipPreflight: false,
  });

  // Wait for transaction confirmation
  await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, "confirmed");

  // Transaction succeeded
  console.log("Transaction succeeded!");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof TransactionExpiredTimeoutError) {
    // Handle transaction timeout error
    console.error(`Transaction ${error.signature} timed out. Please check status using Solana Explorer or CLI tools.`);
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What are the three classes defined in this file and what are their purposes?
- The three classes defined in this file are `TransactionExpiredBlockheightExceededError`, `TransactionExpiredTimeoutError`, and `TransactionExpiredNonceInvalidError`. They are used to represent different types of errors that can occur during a transaction on the Solana blockchain.
2. What properties do these classes have and how are they used?
- Each class has a `signature` property that represents the signature of the transaction that caused the error. This property is set in the constructor of each class and can be accessed later if needed.
3. How are these classes used in the context of the Solana blockchain?
- These classes are likely used by developers building applications on the Solana blockchain to handle errors that may occur during transactions. They provide specific error messages that can be used to inform users of what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.
