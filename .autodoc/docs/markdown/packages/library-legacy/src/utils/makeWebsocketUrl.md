The `makeWebsocketUrl` function in `solana-web3.js` is responsible for generating a WebSocket URL from a given endpoint URL. This function takes in a single argument, `endpoint`, which is a string representing the URL of the endpoint to connect to. The function first checks if the `endpoint` string matches a regular expression pattern defined as `URL_RE`. If the `endpoint` string does not match this pattern, a `TypeError` is thrown with a message indicating that the endpoint URL is invalid.

If the `endpoint` string matches the `URL_RE` pattern, the function extracts the host, port, and path components of the URL using destructuring assignment. The function then determines the appropriate WebSocket protocol (`ws:` or `wss:`) based on whether the `endpoint` URL starts with `https:`. If the `endpoint` URL includes a port number, the function shifts the port number by one and includes it in the WebSocket URL. If the `endpoint` URL does not include a port number, the function omits the port number from the WebSocket URL.

This function is likely used in the larger project to establish a WebSocket connection to a Solana node. Solana is a blockchain platform that uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) to achieve high transaction throughput. The `solana-web3.js` library provides a JavaScript API for interacting with Solana nodes, including sending transactions, querying account balances, and subscribing to real-time updates. The `makeWebsocketUrl` function is used to generate the WebSocket URL needed to establish a real-time connection to a Solana node. For example, the following code snippet demonstrates how the `makeWebsocketUrl` function might be used to connect to a Solana node:

```
import { makeWebsocketUrl } from 'solana-web3.js';

const endpoint = 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com';
const websocketUrl = makeWebsocketUrl(endpoint);

const connection = new WebSocket(websocketUrl);

connection.onopen = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection established');
};

connection.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received message:', event.data);
};

connection.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
};
```

In this example, the `makeWebsocketUrl` function is used to generate a WebSocket URL from the `endpoint` URL of a Solana node running on the mainnet-beta network. The resulting WebSocket URL is then used to create a new WebSocket connection. The `onopen`, `onmessage`, and `onerror` event handlers are used to handle various events that may occur during the WebSocket connection lifecycle. Overall, the `makeWebsocketUrl` function plays an important role in enabling real-time communication between client applications and Solana nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `makeWebsocketUrl` function?
- The `makeWebsocketUrl` function takes an endpoint string and returns a WebSocket URL string with the appropriate protocol, port, and host information.

2. What is the regular expression `URL_RE` used for?
- The `URL_RE` regular expression is used to match and extract the host, port, and path information from a URL string.

3. Why is the `websocketPort` variable calculated differently depending on whether `startPort` is null or not?
- The `websocketPort` variable is calculated differently depending on whether `startPort` is null or not because if `startPort` is null, it means the endpoint URL does not explicitly specify a port, so the WebSocket connection should use the default port for the given protocol. If `startPort` is not null, it means the endpoint URL does explicitly specify a port, so the WebSocket connection should use the next available port after the specified port.
