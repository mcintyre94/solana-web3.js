The code above is a function that performs an assertion check on a given condition. The purpose of this function is to ensure that a certain condition is met before proceeding with the execution of the code. If the condition is not met, an error message is thrown.

The function takes two parameters: `condition` and `message`. The `condition` parameter is the value that needs to be checked. It can be of any data type, including objects, arrays, and functions. The `message` parameter is an optional string that can be used to provide a custom error message. If no message is provided, a default error message is used.

The function uses the `asserts` keyword to indicate that the function performs an assertion check. This keyword is a type assertion that tells TypeScript that the function will throw an error if the condition is not met. This helps to ensure that the code is type-safe and that the assertion check is performed correctly.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  assert(b !== 0, 'Cannot divide by zero');
  return a / b;
}

console.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
console.log(divide(10, 0)); // Throws an error: Cannot divide by zero
```

In the example above, the `divide` function uses the `assert` function to check if the `b` parameter is not equal to zero. If `b` is zero, an error message is thrown, preventing the code from executing further.

Overall, this function is a useful tool for ensuring that certain conditions are met before executing code. It can help to catch errors early on and prevent unexpected behavior in the code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `asserts` keyword in the function signature?
   - The `asserts` keyword indicates that this function is a type assertion function, which checks that the `condition` parameter is true and throws an error if it is not.
2. What is the expected data type of the `condition` parameter?
   - The `condition` parameter has a type of `unknown`, which means that it can be any type. The function will check that it evaluates to true.
3. What happens if the `message` parameter is not provided?
   - If the `message` parameter is not provided, the error message "Assertion failed" will be used instead.
