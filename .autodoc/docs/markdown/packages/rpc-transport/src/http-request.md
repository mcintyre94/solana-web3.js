The `makeHttpRequest` function in this file is responsible for making HTTP POST requests to a specified URL with a given payload. The function takes in a configuration object with two properties: `payload` and `url`. The `payload` property is of type `unknown`, meaning it can be any type of data, and the `url` property is a string representing the URL to send the request to.

The function then creates a `requestInfo` object with the `payload` data as the body of the request, sets the `Content-type` header to `application/json`, and sets the method to `POST`. It then checks whether the code is running in a browser or in Node.js, and uses the appropriate `fetch` implementation to make the request.

If the response from the server is not `ok`, meaning it returned an error status code, the function throws a `SolanaHttpError` with the status text and code as properties. Otherwise, it returns the response data as a JSON object.

This function is likely used throughout the larger project to make HTTP requests to various endpoints, such as querying data from a blockchain or sending transactions. Here is an example usage of the function:

```
const response = await makeHttpRequest({
  payload: { /* some data to send */ },
  url: 'https://example.com/api',
});
console.log(response); // logs the response data as a JSON object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function called `makeHttpRequest` that sends a POST request to a specified URL with a JSON payload, and returns the response as JSON.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on two external packages: `@solana/fetch-impl-browser` and `node-fetch`. The former is used for browser-based environments, while the latter is used for Node.js environments.

3. What is the purpose of the `SolanaHttpError` class?
- The `SolanaHttpError` class is used to throw an error if the HTTP response from the server is not successful (i.e. has a status code other than 200). The error message includes the status text and code.
