  "summary": "The code defines an interface called `GetBlocksApi` which has a single method called `getBlocks`. This method takes in three parameters: `startSlot`, `endSlotInclusive`, and `config`. `startSlot` is a required parameter of type `Slot`, while `endSlotInclusive` and `config` are optional parameters. `endSlotInclusive` is also of type `Slot`, and `config` is an object with a single property called `commitment`. The `commitment` property is also optional and has a default value of `'finalized'`. The `commitment` property is of type `Commitment` which is an enum that includes values such as `'finalized'`, `'confirmed'`, and `'processed'`.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to retrieve a list of confirmed blocks between two specified slots. The `getBlocks` method returns a promise that resolves to an array of `Slot` objects. The `Slot` type is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely defined elsewhere in the project.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to interact with the Solana blockchain and retrieve information about confirmed blocks. For example, a developer could use this code to retrieve a list of blocks between two specified slots and then use that information to perform further analysis or make decisions based on the state of the blockchain.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `getBlocks` method:\n\n```\nimport { GetBlocksApi } from 'solana-web3.js';\n\nconst getBlocksApi: GetBlocksApi = ...; // initialize the GetBlocksApi object\n\nconst startSlot = 100;\nconst endSlotInclusive = 200;\nconst config = { commitment: 'confirmed' };\n\ngetBlocksApi.getBlocks(startSlot, endSlotInclusive, config)\n  .then((blocks) => {\n    console.log(blocks); // array of Slot objects\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```\n\nIn this example, we initialize a `GetBlocksApi` object and then call the `getBlocks` method with a `startSlot` of 100, an `endSlotInclusive` of 200, and a `commitment` of `'confirmed'`. The method returns a promise that resolves to an array of `Slot` objects, which we log to the console. If there is an error, we log it to the console as well.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `GetBlocksApi` interface?\n   - The `GetBlocksApi` interface defines a method `getBlocks` that returns a list of confirmed blocks between two slots.\n\n2. What is the `GetBlocksApiResponse` type?\n   - The `GetBlocksApiResponse` type is an array of `Slot` objects, which represent confirmed blocks.\n\n3. What is the `config` parameter in the `getBlocks` method?\n   - The `config` parameter is an optional object that can be used to specify the `commitment` level for the returned blocks. If not specified, the default is `finalized`."
