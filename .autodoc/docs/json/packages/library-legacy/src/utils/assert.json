  "summary": "The code above is a function that performs an assertion check on a given condition. The purpose of this function is to ensure that a certain condition is met before proceeding with the execution of the code. If the condition is not met, an error message is thrown.\n\nThe function takes two parameters: `condition` and `message`. The `condition` parameter is the value that needs to be checked. It can be of any data type, including objects, arrays, and functions. The `message` parameter is an optional string that can be used to provide a custom error message. If no message is provided, a default error message is used.\n\nThe function uses the `asserts` keyword to indicate that the function performs an assertion check. This keyword is a type assertion that tells TypeScript that the function will throw an error if the condition is not met. This helps to ensure that the code is type-safe and that the assertion check is performed correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nfunction divide(a: number, b: number): number {\n  assert(b !== 0, 'Cannot divide by zero');\n  return a / b;\n}\n\nconsole.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5\nconsole.log(divide(10, 0)); // Throws an error: Cannot divide by zero\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `divide` function uses the `assert` function to check if the `b` parameter is not equal to zero. If `b` is zero, an error message is thrown, preventing the code from executing further.\n\nOverall, this function is a useful tool for ensuring that certain conditions are met before executing code. It can help to catch errors early on and prevent unexpected behavior in the code.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `asserts` keyword in the function signature?\n   - The `asserts` keyword indicates that this function is a type assertion function, which checks that the `condition` parameter is true and throws an error if it is not.\n2. What is the expected data type of the `condition` parameter?\n   - The `condition` parameter has a type of `unknown`, which means that it can be any type. The function will check that it evaluates to true.\n3. What happens if the `message` parameter is not provided?\n   - If the `message` parameter is not provided, the error message \"Assertion failed\" will be used instead."
