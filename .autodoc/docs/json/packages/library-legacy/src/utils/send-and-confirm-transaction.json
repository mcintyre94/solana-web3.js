  "summary": "The `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function is a high-level utility function that signs, sends, and confirms a transaction on the Solana blockchain. It takes in a `Connection` object, a `Transaction` object, an array of `Signer` objects, and optional `ConfirmOptions`. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `TransactionSignature`.\n\nThe function first extracts the `sendOptions` from the `options` object. It then sends the transaction to the Solana network using the `sendTransaction` method of the `Connection` object. The `sendOptions` are passed as the third argument to this method.\n\nOnce the transaction is sent, the function waits for confirmation using the `confirmTransaction` method of the `Connection` object. The `signature` of the transaction is passed as the first argument to this method. If the transaction has a `recentBlockhash` and `lastValidBlockHeight`, these values are used to confirm the transaction. Otherwise, if the transaction has a `minNonceContextSlot` and `nonceInfo`, these values are used to confirm the transaction. If neither of these conditions are met, a warning is logged and the transaction is confirmed using the deprecated confirmation strategy.\n\nIf the transaction fails, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the function returns the `signature` of the transaction.\n\nThis function is a useful utility for developers who want to sign, send, and confirm transactions on the Solana blockchain without having to manually handle the low-level details of the process. Here is an example usage of the function:\n\n```javascript\nimport {Connection, Transaction} from 'solana-web3.js';\n\nconst connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');\nconst transaction = new Transaction().add(...);\nconst signers = [...];\nconst options = {...};\n\nsendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, signers, options)\n  .then((signature) => console.log(`Transaction ${signature} confirmed`))\n  .catch((error) => console.error(error));\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports an async function called `sendAndConfirmTransaction` that signs, sends, and confirms a transaction using a Solana connection, transaction, and signers.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function?\n- The function takes in a `Connection` object, a `Transaction` object, an array of `Signer` objects, and an optional `ConfirmOptions` object that includes an `abortSignal` property.\n\n3. What does the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function return?\n- The function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `TransactionSignature` object."
