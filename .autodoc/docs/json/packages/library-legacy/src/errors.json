  "summary": "This file contains two classes, `SendTransactionError` and `SolanaJSONRPCError`, as well as an object `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` and a type `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCodeEnum`. \n\nThe `SendTransactionError` class extends the built-in `Error` class and adds an optional `logs` property to store an array of strings. This class is likely used to handle errors that occur when sending a transaction to the Solana blockchain. The `logs` property can be used to store any relevant logs or error messages that may be useful for debugging.\n\nThe `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` object is a constant object that maps error codes to specific error messages. This object is used to handle errors that occur during JSON-RPC requests to the Solana blockchain. The error codes are negative integers and the corresponding error messages are defined in `client/src/rpc_custom_errors.rs`. \n\nThe `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCodeEnum` type is a union type that represents all possible values of the `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` object. This type is used to ensure that only valid error codes are used when handling JSON-RPC errors.\n\nThe `SolanaJSONRPCError` class extends the built-in `Error` class and adds a `code` property of type `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCodeEnum` and an optional `data` property of any type. This class is used to handle errors that occur during JSON-RPC requests to the Solana blockchain. The `code` property is used to store the error code and the `data` property can be used to store any additional data that may be useful for debugging. \n\nOverall, this file provides error handling functionality for the Solana blockchain. The `SendTransactionError` class is used to handle errors that occur when sending transactions to the blockchain, while the `SolanaJSONRPCError` class is used to handle errors that occur during JSON-RPC requests to the blockchain. The `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` object and `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCodeEnum` type are used to ensure that only valid error codes are used when handling JSON-RPC errors. \n\nExample usage of `SolanaJSONRPCError`:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // make JSON-RPC request to Solana blockchain\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof SolanaJSONRPCError) {\n    console.log(`Error code: ${error.code}`);\n    console.log(`Error message: ${error.message}`);\n    console.log(`Additional data: ${error.data}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Unexpected error: ${error}`);\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SendTransactionError` class and what does it contain?\n- The `SendTransactionError` class extends the `Error` class and contains an optional array of logs. It is used to represent errors that occur when sending a transaction.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` object and how is it used?\n- The `SolanaJSONRPCErrorCode` object is a constant object that maps error codes to specific error messages. It is used to identify and handle specific errors that occur during JSON-RPC calls.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SolanaJSONRPCError` class and what does it contain?\n- The `SolanaJSONRPCError` class extends the `Error` class and contains a code, message, and optional data. It is used to represent errors that occur during JSON-RPC calls and provides additional information about the error."
