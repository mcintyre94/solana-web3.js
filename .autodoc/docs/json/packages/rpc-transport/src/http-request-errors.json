  "summary": "The code defines a custom error class called `SolanaHttpError` that extends the built-in `Error` class. This error class is designed to handle HTTP errors that may occur when interacting with the Solana blockchain through the Solana Web3.js library. \n\nThe `SolanaHttpError` class takes in an object called `details` that contains two properties: `statusCode` and `message`. The `statusCode` property is a number that represents the HTTP status code of the error, while the `message` property is a string that provides additional information about the error. \n\nWhen an instance of `SolanaHttpError` is created, it calls the `Error` constructor with a formatted message that includes the `statusCode` and `message` properties from the `details` object. It also captures a stack trace for the error using the `Error.captureStackTrace` method. Finally, it sets the `statusCode` property of the instance to the `statusCode` property from the `details` object.\n\nThis error class can be used throughout the Solana Web3.js library to handle HTTP errors that may occur when making requests to the Solana blockchain. For example, if a request to retrieve the balance of a Solana wallet fails due to an HTTP error, the Solana Web3.js library can throw an instance of `SolanaHttpError` with the appropriate `statusCode` and `message` properties to provide more information about the error to the developer. \n\nHere is an example of how the `SolanaHttpError` class might be used in the Solana Web3.js library:\n\n```typescript\nimport { SolanaHttpError } from 'solana-web3.js';\n\nasync function getBalance(walletAddress: string): Promise<number> {\n  const response = await fetch(`https://api.solana.com/v1/account/${walletAddress}`);\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const details = {\n      statusCode: response.status,\n      message: `Failed to retrieve balance for wallet ${walletAddress}`\n    };\n    throw new SolanaHttpError(details);\n  }\n  const data = await response.json();\n  return data.balance;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getBalance` function makes a request to the Solana API to retrieve the balance of a wallet with the specified address. If the response is not `ok`, indicating an HTTP error, the function throws an instance of `SolanaHttpError` with the appropriate `statusCode` and `message` properties. This allows the developer to handle the error in a more granular way and provide more detailed error messages to the end user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a custom error class called SolanaHttpError that is used to handle HTTP errors in a Solana-specific way.\n\n2. What is the structure of the SolanaHttpErrorDetails object?\n   The SolanaHttpErrorDetails object has two properties: statusCode (a number representing the HTTP status code of the error) and message (a string containing a description of the error).\n\n3. How is the SolanaHttpError class different from a standard Error object?\n   The SolanaHttpError class extends the standard Error object and adds a statusCode property to store the HTTP status code of the error. It also overrides the name property to return 'SolanaHttpError' instead of 'Error'."
